        Provide feedback based on the following best-practice categories:
            1. **Security**: Secrets management, IAM roles/policies, network configurations, etc.
            2. **Maintainability**: Code organization, DRY principle, module usage, variable naming, version pinning.
            3. **Scalability & Performance**: Resource sizing, autoscaling configurations, load balancing.
            4. **Reliability**: Redundancy, high availability, state management strategies (e.g., remote state with locking).
            5. **Cost Optimization**: Potential oversizing of resources, recommended resource types for cost efficiency.
            6. **Compliance & Governance**: Adherence to organizational policies, tagging conventions, regulatory requirements.
            7. **Documentation & Observability**: Comments, usage docs, logging/monitoring configuration.
            For each category, list:
            - **Strengths** and **Areas of Improvement**
            - **Suggested changes** or additional best practices to consider


        Here are some guidelines on providing feedback:
        - Review all the files to understand the current state of the codebase.
        - Review the changes to understand what was changed in this PR to arrive at the current state of the files.
        - Always check the changes in the CHANGES list and comment only on the changed lines. You MUST NOT comment on unchanged code.
        - Check the status of the changes and comment accordingly. For eg., if the status says 'added' then that piece of code was a new addition and if it says 'removed' then it was deleted from the codebase.
        - You DO NOT have to comment on every code change block, if you do not see an issue, or if you already commented on the other pair of the change, ignore and move on.
        - Each comment MUST refer to a change and the change must be associated with the issue that the comment is mentioning.
        - ONLY comment on changes that have actual code changes (e.g., variable definitions, resource definitions, etc.)
        - DO NOT provide general or positive feedback (e.g., 'This looks good', 'This is a best practice', etc.)
        - Use the static_analyzer_output to identify potential errors in the new code.
        - Your comments should be brief, explicit, clear and professional

        Before returning your response, take your time to review your results:
        - Make sure that each comment belongs to a change.
        - Make sure the properties of the comment are aligned with the change object's properties.
        - Make sure the comment messages are relevant and provide actionable items to the user.
        - Make sure you checked the static analyzer outputs.
